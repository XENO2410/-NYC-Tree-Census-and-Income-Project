![Dashboard 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0afa30bc-2d46-47f0-88a3-6e1281ba6266)

## Overview

This repository contains the NYC Tree Census and Income project, which is divided into two main parts: Data Setup and Data Visualization. The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between tree distribution and income levels in New York City using Tableau.

## Part I: Data Setup

### Objectives
By the end of this part, the project will have:
- Loaded multiple datasets into Tableau
- Renamed and formatted columns for optimal readability
- Joined datasets on a common field
- Saved the work privately to Tableau Public
- Become familiar with the data in preparation for creating visualizations

### Steps

1. **Loading Data**
   - Multiple datasets, including the NYC Tree Census, NYC Native Trees, and NYC Income data, are loaded into Tableau.

2. **Renaming and Formatting Columns**
   - Columns are renamed and formatted to enhance readability and understanding.

3. **Joining Datasets**
   - Datasets are joined on a common field to integrate information from different sources.

4. **Saving Work**
   - The work is saved privately to Tableau Public to ensure accessibility and security.

5. **Familiarizing with Data**
   - A thorough exploration of the data is conducted to identify key insights and trends, setting the stage for effective visualizations.

### Note
- The data filename used in the setup differs from the one in the video tutorial. The dataset "tree-census-NYC_2015.csv" from the GitHub repository is used instead of "2015StreetTreesCensus_TREES".

## Part II: Data Visualization

### Objectives
By the end of this part, the project will have:
- Created basic data visualizations with a focus on narrative and argument
- Adjusted aesthetic properties to enhance the visual argument
- Added labels and tooltips for clarity and interactivity
- Filtered data to improve the user experience
- Presented visualizations as a cohesive, balanced dashboard

### Steps

1. **Creating Visualizations**
   - Basic visualizations are created to start building the narrative and argument from the data.

2. **Adjusting Aesthetics**
   - Aesthetic properties of the visualizations are adjusted to further the visual argument and improve clarity.

3. **Adding Labels and Tooltips**
   - Labels and tooltips are added to provide additional information and enhance interactivity.

4. **Filtering Data**
   - Data is filtered to focus on relevant information and improve the overall user experience.

5. **Presenting Dashboard**
   - Visualizations are combined into a cohesive and balanced dashboard that effectively communicates the findings.

## Data Sources

- **NYC Tree Census**: Provides detailed information on the trees in New York City.
- **NYC Native Trees Dataset**: Contains data on native tree species in New York City.
- **NYC Income Data**: Provides income levels across different regions of New York City.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Follow Part I**: Complete the data setup steps in Tableau.
3. **Proceed to Part II**: Create and refine visualizations to develop a comprehensive dashboard.
4. **Review and Present**: Ensure the dashboard is cohesive and effectively communicates the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a structured approach to analyzing the relationship between tree distribution and income levels in New York City using Tableau. By following the outlined steps, one can gain valuable insights and present findings through an interactive and informative dashboard.
